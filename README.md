**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. It contains information on over 5,000 patients from different regions of the world, including their age, gender, smoking status, hypertension status, heart disease status, and more.

**Analysis:**

Using SQL queries and data visualization techniques, this project aims to identify factors that increase the likelihood of stroke. Some of the questions explored in this analysis include:

1. What is the distribution of strokes among different age groups and genders?
2. Is there a relationship between smoking and stroke?
3. What is the correlation between hypertension and stroke?
4. Are there any significant differences in stroke risk based on patient location or lifestyle factors?
5. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform public health interventions and improve stroke prevention strategies.

**Results:**

The majority of stroke cases occurred in patients over the age of 50, with the highest incidence rates in the 70-79 age group. Women were more likely than men to have a stroke.
The data suggests that smoking is a significant risk factor for stroke, with current smokers having a higher incidence rate of stroke than non-smokers and former smokers.
Hypertension was found to be strongly correlated with stroke, with patients with hypertension being almost twice as likely to have a stroke as patients without hypertension.
While there were some variations in stroke incidence rates based on patient location and lifestyle factors such as work type and alcohol consumption, these differences were not statistically significant.
Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of identifying and managing stroke risk factors, such as hypertension and smoking, in order to reduce the incidence of stroke and improve public health.

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates the power of SQL for data analysis and highlights the importance of understanding stroke risk factors. With further research and refinement, the findings from this analysis could potentially contribute to the development of more effective stroke prevention and treatment strategies.
