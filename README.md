# Analyzing Stroke Risk Factors using SQL


Stroke Risk Factors:

This project analyzes a dataset of stroke patients and their medical history using SQL. The dataset includes information on patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and medical history.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle here. It contains information on over 5,000 patients from different regions of the world, including their age, gender, smoking status, hypertension status, heart disease status, and more.

Analysis
Using SQL queries and data visualization techniques, this project aims to identify factors that increase the likelihood of stroke. Some of the questions explored in this analysis include:

What is the distribution of strokes among different age groups and genders?
Is there a relationship between smoking and stroke?
What is the correlation between hypertension and stroke?
Are there any significant differences in stroke risk based on patient location or lifestyle factors?
The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform public health interventions and improve stroke prevention strategies.

Files
The project files include the SQL code used to query the dataset, as well as the resulting tables and visualizations. The code is organized into different sections based on the research questions explored.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL for data analysis and highlights the importance of understanding stroke risk factors. With further research and refinement, the findings from this analysis could potentially contribute to the development of more effective stroke prevention and treatment strategies.
